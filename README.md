# Pokemon_dataset
### This is the data analysis and prediction part
In the world of Pokemon, there are legendary and non-legendary pokemon. Here, check if your pokemon is legendary or not.
I have used the chi-square test to find out if there is a relationship between the type of pokemon and whether it being legendary.
I have used SMOTE for dealing with the imbalance in the dataset(contains only 8% minority class).
Kernel SVM gave the best accuracy for the dataset.
Pokemon! Gotta catch'em all!!
